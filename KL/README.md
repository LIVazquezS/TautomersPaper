# Kullblack Leibler Divergency Analysis

On this repository are the required files to perform the KL divergency analysis of different databases. 

## Files
- Mol Measure: Code that computes the bond lenghts of a given molecule on xyz format. There are examples on how the calculation is performed. 
- Metrics: It contains the code to compute KL divergency from a .csv that contains the information of the bond lenghts on the databases. 

## TO DO
- Extend Mol Measure to include angles, improper dihedrals and dihedrals.
- Extend for optimization of KL divergency.
