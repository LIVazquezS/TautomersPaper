# Analysis of Prediction Errors in the Tautobase using TMAP

Plots were generated using the TMAP algorithm (https://github.com/reymond-group/tmap/tree/master/tmap).
Additional analysis, using RDKit and data generated in /Amons_Analysis/, were added as extra features in the interactive visualisations (index.html) present in all folders.
Interactive graphs can be opened in any reliable browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

All credit, and many thanks, to Daniel Probst for his development of TMAP and MHFP (https://github.com/reymond-group/mhfp) which afforded this analysis.
